<h1> How it was built </h1>
The program was built using a combination of Python, React, CSS, MongoDB and Tensorflow. React provided the website's basic structure, CSS was used to style the page and make it visually appealing, and Python was used to add interactivity and dynamic behaviour to the website. MongoDB was used to store the information sent by the user in a secure place where it can be accessed at any time. Finally, we used TensorFlow's deep learning model and natural language processing to improve
user experience in discovering recipes based on saved ingredients, achieving a 95% accuracy rate. The full list of everything used is below:
<ul>
<li>Python</li>
<li>Django</li>
<li>TensorFlow</li>
<li>React</li>
<li>MongoDB</li>
<li>Docker</li>
<li>Figma</li>
</ul>

<h1> The Design </h1>
In creating the user interface design for RecipeRadar, we leveraged the capabilities of Figma. The result was a streamlined, contemporary layout that effectively communicated the fridge concept we were trying to replicate. The user's items are stored in the fridge, shown in the design as an intuitive way for the user to interact with the website.
